        Hi my name is Tiffany and this is a website to showcase my projects to y'all ;))) I am a high schooler in 
     Abraham Lincoln High School and I'm a very fun and loud person if you get to know me. I love to stay home or 
     travel around the world during breaks. I have 5 goldfishes that have lived for 3 years, which is very long for 
     goldfishes. I am currently learning coding and I am hoping that y'all will like my projects I've made :))
